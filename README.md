# B-cell_epitope_pred

Scripts I've developed for the identification and analysis of potential B-cell epitopes. B-cell epitopes are of groups of amino acids located on the surface of protein antigens that determine their antigenicity. The identification and evaluation of the potential epitopes were based both on the linear sequences and structural information about the proteins. Aside from peptide/protein analysis, the list also includes scripts for automated data extraction, cleansing and other pre-processing methods.
